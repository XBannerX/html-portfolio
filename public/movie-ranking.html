  of American history through the perspective of its simple-minded, kind-hearted
  titular character from Alabama. Though he has an IQ of 75 and wore leg braces

  events and extraordinary achievements.

<h3>Aladdin</h3>

<p>
  The story of Aladdin generally follows a kind-hearted but impoverished young
  man who discovers a magic lamp containing a powerful, wish-granting Genie.
  With the Genie's help, Aladdin transforms himself into a wealthy prince to woo
  the beautiful Princess Jasmine, whom he met in the marketplace. However, the
  wicked royal advisor, Jafar, seeks the lamp for himself to seize power and
  overthrow the Sultan. Through cleverness and bravery, Aladdin thwarts Jafar's
  evil schemes, eventually tricking the villain into becoming a genie himself
  and trapping him in a lamp. In the end, Aladdin chooses to free his friend the
  Genie with his final wish, proving his noble character; the Sultan then
  changes the law to allow the princess to marry for love, and Aladdin and
  Jasmine live happily ever after.
